# Count Word Frequencies

# You are given a string of text, and your task is to count how often each word appears in the string. You should return the result as a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are their respective counts. The function should ignore capitalization (i.e., "Word" and "word" should be considered the same word).

# Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barked."
# Output: {
#     'the': 3,
#     'quick': 1,
#     'brown': 1,
#     'fox': 1,
#     'jumps': 1,
#     'over': 1,
#     'lazy': 1,
#     'dog': 2,
#     'barked': 1
# }
