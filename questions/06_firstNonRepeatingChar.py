# Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String
# Write a JavaScript function firstNonRepeatingChar that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character in the string. If all characters are repeating, return null.


def first_non_repeating_char(s):

    # Count occurrences of each character

    # Find the first character with a count of 1

    # If no non-repeating character is found


print(first_non_repeating_char("swiss"))   # "w"
print(first_non_repeating_char("success"))  # "u"
print(first_non_repeating_char("aabbcc"))  # None
